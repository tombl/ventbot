**Getting the bot setup:**
[Invite the bot to your server.](/invite)
Run `/ventbot` in a channel of your choice to create a vent button.
It is recommended to pin that message.

Then, head to Server Settings > Integrations > ventbot
There you can limit access to `/ventbot` to only moderators of the server.
